Requirements to build LunaLua yourself
------
Visual Studio 2015 (msvc140 compiler)


Note for Qt Creator IDE
------
If you wish you edit code via Qt Creator, you still must have Visual Studio because MSVC compiler is required.
**How to setup building from Qt creator**
* Open project and configure it
* Go to the "Projects" tab
* Disable shadow build for both Debug and Release
* remove ALL items from "Building" and "Cenaring" sections
* Add into "Building" a special item with:
 ** Command "build.bat"
 ** Argument "Debug" for debug build and "Release" argument for release build
* Add into "Clearing" a special item with "clear.bat" command
* Try to build project. If you have "MSBuild" in another path, please modify build.bat to take working build!
