--This can go in your lunaworld.lua (if you wanted to set a constant time for each level) or in your
--lunadll.lua file if you wanted it on a per level basis.
--Usage is SIMILAR to the death counter, a little more is needed though


--We declare an instance of the timerApi, like the death counter
timerApi = loadAPI("leveltimer");

function onLoad()  
	--But now in the onLoad override, we set a few values
	timerApi.setSecondsLeft(300);
 --For one, we need to set the timer value. No greater than 999
	timerApi.setTimerState(true);
 --Then, we need to make sure we enable it. It's not enabled by default
