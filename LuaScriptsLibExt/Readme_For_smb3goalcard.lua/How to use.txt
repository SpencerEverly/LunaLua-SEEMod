HOW TO USE

--SETUP--
1 . Copy/Paste the smb3goalcard.lua file and smb3goalcard folder into your LuaScriptsLib folder which should be in the root of your SMBX folder. (../SMBX/LuaScriptsLib/)

--IMPLEMENTING INTO YOUR SMBX EPISODE/LEVEL--
1 . Make a new file in your worlds folder called LunaWorld.lua.
2 . Add " smb3card = loadAPI("smb3goalcard"); " to the file.
3 . In your onLoad function, you can toggle the card function on/off
with " smb3card.usesCard(TRUE/FALSE); "
4 . If you want to have a certain level not use the card function, or if
it doesn't have a card, add the above line, set it to false, and put it
into a LunaDll.lua file in that levels graphic folder.
