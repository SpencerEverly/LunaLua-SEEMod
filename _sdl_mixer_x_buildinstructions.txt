HOW TO BUILD SDL MIXER X
----------

Pre-Requisites
----

1. To install SDL2, you'll need the following:

- CMake (The latest version)
- Visual Studio 2015 (For building it for SMBX2)
- Git (For downloading the repositories)
- yasm (For part of building SDL Mixer X. Use the 32 bit version. It should go to "Program Files (x86)" in your C Drive)

-------

Building SDL Mixer X
----

Make sure WHERE you build the project DOESN'T have any folders with spaces!!!!

1. Open up cmd (Command Prompt). Run it as an Admin just in case.

2. Clone the following if you haven't yet:
git clone https://github.com/WohlSoft/AudioCodecs.git
git clone https://github.com/WohlSoft/SDL-Mixer-X.git

3. Go to the AudioCodecs commit folder. 
cd AudioCodecs

4. Run the following:
mkdir build
cd build

And then run this:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_LOCAL_SDL2=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="E:/Github/AudioCodecs/build/out/" .. -DYASM_ASSEMBLER="C:/Program Files (x86)/yasm" -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" -A Win32 ..

5. It should start making part of the build. Now run this after it's done:
cmake --build . --config Release --target install

6. It should now build an SDL2.dll file into the "out" folder in the build folder. Now type up the following:

cd../.. (This backs out two folders)
cd SDL-Mixer-X
mkdir build
cd build

Then do this:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="E:/Github/SDL-Mixer-X/build/out/" -DAUDIO_CODECS_INSTALL_PATH="E:/Github/AudioCodecs/build/out/" -DAUDIO_CODECS_REPO_PATH="E:/Github/AudioCodecs/" .. -DMIXERX_ENABLE_GPL=ON -DAUDIO_CODECS_BUILD_LOCAL_SDL2=ON -DDOWNLOAD_AUDIO_CODECS_DEPENDENCY=OFF -DSDL_MIXER_X_SHARED=ON -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" -A Win32 ..

7. From there, finally do this:
cmake --build . --config Release --target install

8. SDL Mixer X should be spat out into the "out" folder in the build folder.

9. We're not done yet. We gotta put the new DLL files into the SMBX2 SEE Mod, and also update the source code in the SEE Mod LunaLua architecture as well. First, copy the SDL2.dll file from "C:\(buildfolder)\AudioCodecs\build\bin" to the bin folder on your SMBX2 install. Also copy the file from "C:\(buildfolder)\SDL-Mixer-X-Final\bin" to the bin folder on your SMBX2 install. You also want to replace them on the LunaLua SEE Mod as well: "LunaLua-SEEMod-master\LunaDll\libs\sdl\bin" in case.

10. We're now gonna update the code in the sdl folder. Copy the "include" and "lib" folders in "C:\(buildfolder)\SDL-Mixer-X\build\out" and paste them to where this is at in the LunaLua SEE Mod: "LunaLua-SEEMod-master\LunaDll\libs\sdl" and replace if it says so.

11. Copy everything under "C:\(buildfolder)\SDL-Mixer-X\build\out\lib" and paste it to "LunaLua-SEEMod-master\LunaDll\libs\sdl\lib"

12. Everything should now be good to go! You can rebuild the LunaLua project if you want, which should be recommended if you want the internal program to detect newer SDL Mixer X stuff.
