==== SMBX Recontstructed ====

This folder contains reconstructed Methods from SMBX. They should be mostly 1:1, but readable C/C++ code.

The following two headers can be used by other files:

- ReconstructedDefines.h        Includes all reconstructed function with their settings

Because this (sub)-project goes deep into SMBX, this file should not go outside SMBXInternal!

The following headers are used outside of SMBXInternal:
 Defines.h

 Every Cpp File has information about the original overwritten method.
